        <section id="about"> <h2>All about Persian Cats</h2>
        <p>They are medium sized cats with flat faces, small ears, and very long fur. They do have some health issues like kidney disease. Their lifespan is about 12-17 years. There are some varients of them like the Dollface Persian, Himilayan Persian, and the Traditional Persian. Fun fact: An Exotic Shorthair cat is a mix of a Persian cat and a Shorthair cat.</p><br>
            <p>Persian cats weren't meant to look just like they do. They originally looked like this (image on the left) they now look like this (image on the right)</p>
